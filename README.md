OnePageWebsite
==============

An example of a one page portfolio responsive website using jQuery and JavaScript.

Entire deploy directory of my responsive portfolio website, which use jQuery and JavaScript to transition between pages.

To preload the site, run on a server and comment out the "files = [];" in "index.html". Otherwise, this should run out of the box.
