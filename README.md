OnePageWebsite
==============

An example of a one page portfolio website using jQuery and JavaScript

Entire deploy directory of my portfolio website, which use jQuery and JavaScript to transition between pages.

To preload the site, run on a server and comment out the "files = [];" in "index.html". Otherwise, this should run out of the box.
